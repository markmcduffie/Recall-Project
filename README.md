# Recall-Project
CSE6242 Team 071 Project Code Files

## Description
The python package conatianing the majority of our project code is project_0_5. Our code steps through the process of how we built our various models for automobile stock price estimation in the event of a recall. The statistical analysis used for obtaining our recall indicator values that we used in the regression models can be found in the recall_indicator.RMD file.

## Installation
### Requirements
Python 3.10 or later  
pip installer for Python  
The following Python libraries: pandas; numpy; matplotlib; seaborn; scipy; ta; sklearn; statsmodels; pmdarima

R  
The Following R packages:  
dplyr; rstanarm; ggplot2; sandwich; xts; msm; lubridate

## Execution
1. R Markdown File:
  * Run 'recall_indicator.Rmd' in RStudio to generate the 'recall_indicator.csv' (this will later be used as the recall indicator for the regression models and correlation analysis) 
2. Jupyter Notebook:
  * Open 'Project_0_5.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook
  * Execute the cells sequentially to perform the analysis
